## ocp-examples install

Simply run,
```
./install.sh
```

This will create ~/perf-test and copy all the test files into that folder for the
sake of convenience. After this is done, ```cd ~/perf-test``` and run tests from that 
folder. 

Each subfolder under this folder has its own README on how to run the individual test.
